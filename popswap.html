            <p> <strong>June 2016:</strong> While attending college orientation, I noticed how difficult it was to share all of my contact information (phone, snapchat, instagram, etc.) with groups of people. That’s when I realized that a mobile app could potentially solve this issue. The only problem: I had no idea how apps worked, how to code apps, or where to learn how to make them.  </p> 

             <p> <strong>August 2016:</strong>  We released the first version of our app on the Apple App Store. We decided on the name “Swappl” (it turned out nobody knew how to spell it). I remember going to bed thinking I was going to wake up with a billion-dollar acquisition the next morning. Unfortunately, it did not happen. </p> 


             <p> <strong>October 2016:</strong> We made several updates to Swappl while trying to get as much feedback. Started getting a few hundred users, but daily active numbers plateaued. 
  </p> 

              <p> <strong>January 2017:</strong> Released second version of the app, renamed “PopSwap” (much better name). Started getting the most traction that we ever had. Feeling excited about the idea. 
 </p> 

               <p> <strong>February 2017:</strong> Won third place in a university-wide competition, but traction started decreasing.   </p> 

                <p> <strong>March 2017:</strong> Met with college orientation director, business school director, and several companies hoping to incorporate app into their organizations. Nobody agreed to use it.  </p> 

                 <p> <strong>May 2017</strong> One final push for traction. Released an update that fixed several bugs.   </p> 

                  <p> <strong>June 2017:</strong> Cancelled server subscriptions and called it a day. No hard feelings :)  </p>

<h3> Takeaways </h3> 
          
            <li> <strong>“If you build it they will come” is absolutely not true:</strong> our app idea sounded incredible on paper. We built an app that solved a problem for people, but we still didn’t get any traction. This means that we weren’t able to create enough value for the user. Just because you build something cool does not mean people will use it. </li>
            <li> <strong>Test your ideas faster and release things earlier:</strong> we spent way too long perfecting everything instead of getting valuable feedback. We could have avoided many challenges if we weren’t so stubborn.
  </li>
            <li> <strong>Don’t fall into the Sunk Cost fallacy:</strong> about six months in, we knew that the app probably wouldn’t get popular. Instead of quitting, we kept going because we had already invested so much time into the app. In retrospect, we should have quit earlier.</li>
            <li> <strong>App ideas are worthless:</strong> Before making the app, I used to get super excited any app idea that anyone had. My friends and I used to keep our app ideas secret so we wouldn’t steal them. In reality, app ideas are almost worthless, it’s nearly all about execution. Now I cringe when people say they have a “million dollar app idea and just need someone to code it.” 
</li>
            <li> <strong>Focus on marketing strategy:</strong> This relates to the other points, but we should have figured out how we would market the app before it was finished. Pre-product marketing is just as if not more important than post-product marketing.</li><br><br>
