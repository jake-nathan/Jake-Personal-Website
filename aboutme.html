            <p> I am a 19 year old Austinite who was seen this city grow into an incredible bastion of technology, culture, and beauty. For nearly my entire life, I have created new things. It started with filming and editing YouTube videos in elementary school. Then I started making graphics in Photoshop in middle school. In high school, I started making business plans and starting small businesses. Now, I am constantly starting new things and testing business ideas. This journey of creation has allowed me to learn new skills, meet incredible people, and grow myself as a person and a leader. My mission is to continue to create as much as possible and inspire others to do the same. </p>
