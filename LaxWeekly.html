            <p> For as long as I can remember, lacrosse has been a passion of mine. After years of bouncing around ideas in my head, I decided it was finally time to start a website about the sport. After writing my first 10 articles, I realized I had no idea how to grow a website. I had no money to spend on advertising, so I was forced to think about bringing traffic to my site without money. </p> <br>
            <p> I started contacting high school lacrosse players with email addresses that I found on their YouTube highlight reels. I emailed them asking to do phone interviews about their lacrosse careers. Immediately, I recieved incredible response rates and busied myself with phone interviews after work. After the phone interview, I would write an article about the player and send it to them to share on social media. Instantly, my website went from 1-2 page views/day to sometimes 1,000 page views/day. </p> <br>
            <p> After posting several articles about the lacrosse players I had interviewed, I knew I was onto something. This is when I had <strong> my first big marketing realization: I had made content that was inherently shareable for an unfulfilled market. </strong> After each article I posted, friends, family, high schools, club teams, and other organizations affiliated to the lacrosse player would share the article on social media, garnering tens of thousands of impressions. All of this sharing happened without me spending a penny on advertising. People shared these articles because they solved an unfulfilled problem: lacrosse players did not have enough written about them. </p> <br>
            <p> After a few weeks, I wanted to figure out how to monetize my website. After searching around, I decied on the Amazon Affiliate program: a platform that allows website owners to make money when visitors click on links to Amazon products on the website. After each article, I started adding links to lacrosse gear that was relevant to the page. Before I knew it, I started making enough money to cover the website expenses. I could not believe I was able to make money working on my passion. </p> <br>
            <p> Now, I've been fortunate enough to talk to some of the world's greatest lacrosse players and learn from their experiences. In August 2017, I was invited to cover the Major League Lacrosse championships in Dallas, Texas. Although LaxWeekly will most likely not be my primary source of income, this website has given me incredible opportunites to learn and grow. I can apply the marketing principles I have learned from this website and use it to grow other businesses.  </p> <br> <br>
